# 1. 常见的三种注解注入方式对比

## Field 注入

```
@RestController
public class LoginController {

    @Autowired
    private UserService userService;

    
}
```

field 注入方式是使用最多的，原因是这种方式使用起来非常简单，代码更加简洁。

## Setter 方法注入

```
@RestController
public class LoginController {

    private UserService userService;

    @Autowired
    public void setUserService(UserService userService) {
        this.userService = userService;
    }
}
```

## Constructor 注入

```
@RestController
public class LoginController {

    private final UserService userService;

    @Autowired
    public LoginController(UserService userService) {
        this.userService = userService;
    }

}

```





# 2. 构造器注入还是 Setter 注入？

构造器注入还是Setter方法注入,引用官方说法.
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#beans-dependency-resolution

>Since you can mix constructor-based and setter-based DI, it is a good rule of thumb to use constructors for mandatory dependencies and setter methods or configuration methods for optional dependencies. Note that use of the [@Autowired](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#beans-autowired-annotation) annotation on a setter method can be used to make the property be a required dependency; however, constructor injection with programmatic validation of arguments is preferable.
>
>The Spring team generally advocates constructor injection, as it lets you implement application components as immutable objects and ensures that required dependencies are not null. Furthermore, constructor-injected components are always returned to the client (calling) code in a fully initialized state. As a side note, a large number of constructor arguments is a bad code smell, implying that the class likely has too many responsibilities and should be refactored to better address proper separation of concerns.
>
>Setter injection should primarily only be used for optional dependencies that can be assigned reasonable default values within the class. Otherwise, not-null checks must be performed everywhere the code uses the dependency. One benefit of setter injection is that setter methods make objects of that class amenable to reconfiguration or re-injection later. Management through [JMX MBeans](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#jmx) is therefore a compelling use case for setter injection.
>
>Use the DI style that makes the most sense for a particular class. Sometimes, when dealing with third-party classes for which you do not have the source, the choice is made for you. For example, if a third-party class does not expose any setter methods, then constructor injection may be the only available form of DI.



***构造器注入*** 有利于强制依赖。通过在构造函数中提供依赖，您可以确保依赖对象在被构造时已准备好被使用。在构造函数中赋值的字段也可以是final的，这使得对象是完全不可变的，或者至少可以保护其必需的字段。

构造器注入还可以避免 **Field 注入**的循环依赖问题，Spring启动自检会报错BeanCurrentlyInCreationException .

构造器参数过多则说明该类承担过多职责,应该进行重构.

***Setter注入***比较灵活,依赖可以通过修改setter重新注入,但是有可能因为null依赖问题.
